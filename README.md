# Basic-Search-Algorithm
Complete List of Basic Search Algorithms
1. Uninformed (Blind) Search
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
Bidirectional Search (searches from start and goal simultaneously)

2. Informed (Heuristic) Search
Greedy Best-First Search
A Search*
Beam Search
Hill Climbing (local search variant)
Simulated Annealing

3. Constraint Satisfaction
Backtracking
Forward Checking
Arc Consistency (AC-3)

4. Adversarial Search
Minimax
Alpha-Beta Pruning
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

5. Probabilistic Search
Random Walk
Genetic Algorithms

6. Specialized Search
Ternary Search (for unimodal functions)
Jump Search (for sorted arrays)
Interpolation Search (for uniformly distributed data)

7. Modern Variants
Tabu Search (avoids revisiting solutions)
Swarm Algorithms (e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization)
